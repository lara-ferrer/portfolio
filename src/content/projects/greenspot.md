**Greenspot** is an app which aims to show a list of local businesses inspired by a conscious, cruelty free and sustainable mindset.
It started as a part of my final thesis for my higher studies in Web Development, and became a side project where I can get creative, develop my own [Design System (Kiwi)](/projects/kiwi-design-system) and show my passion for a sustainable mindset when consuming food and fashion.
