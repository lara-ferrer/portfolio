![Design Tokens Workshop](/design-tokens-workshop.png)

I was asked to taught a workshop for **Garaje de Ideas' Youtube channel**, a consultancy firm which has a section called **Garaje Live Coding** which has a variety of topics related to web development, Design Systems and many more.

In the workshop I talk about my experience in Design Tokens from a development perspective, and also how to create your own tokens in Figma using plugins like Figma Tokens.
