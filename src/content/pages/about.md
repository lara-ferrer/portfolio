![About me](/hero.jpg)

Hey there! 🙋‍♀️

I am Lara, a restless soul born in the city of the wind 🍃 (also known as Zaragoza - a city from Spain!). Since I was a teen I began to feel curious about the union of creativity with technology and I began to take my first steps in the world of web design from a young age 🖥

By then it was clear to me that I was going to dedicate myself to it when I was older, but life took me on very different paths and I ended up studying different disciplines 📚, which gave me very valuable knowledge, but which did not fulfill me. Years later I recovered the illusion I had for the world of web design and development ❤️ and I am currently working on it! I continue to enjoy and learn from my profession like the first day, with the same passion as that girl who began to dream with coding. 🙌

I love to learn on my own in my free time. I am restless and curious by nature and I always try to gain valuable learning from any experience. When I'm not working I like to dedicate myself to my social networks 📲, to photography 📸, to try to do some yoga and mindfulness 🙏 or to other more diverse activities such as learning more about space. 🚀
